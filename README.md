Hive SerDe schema generator
==============

With the help of this excellent tool, you are now able to generate a SerDe schema from *.json file, which is in standard SerDe format, e.g. one JSON per line.

The generator is written in Scala, a JVM language, which makes it insanely fast and enables it to run with what you already have installed.

Example usage (with instructions)
---
First, you have to install SBT (Scala Build Tool), which is the only dependency, besides JDK. You can do that here: http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

In the source tree, there is the following JSON in the file `example/users.json`, so we'll use it for demonstration purposes.

```json
{"id":1, "name":"Rok", "income":null, "city":{"name":"Grosuplje", "area":12544}, "children":[{"name":"Matej"}]}
{"id":2, "name":"Jo≈æica", "cars":[], "num":12345678901234.5, "employed":true, "children":null}
{"id":3, "name":"Simon", "num":0.12, "city":{"area":1234.5434}, "children":[{"name":"Simonca"},{"name":"Matic", "toy":"Ropotulica"}]}
```

When we run `sbt "run example/users.json"`, we get the following output. The output can then be either copied or redirected to the output file file.

```sql
ADD JAR hive-json-serde-0.2.jar;

CREATE TABLE data (
	children ARRAY<
		STRUCT<
			toy: VARCHAR(10),
			name: VARCHAR(7)
		>
	>,
	city STRUCT<
		name: VARCHAR(9),
		area: DOUBLE
	>,
	name VARCHAR(6),
	cars ARRAY<
		???
	>,
	num NUMERIC(16, 2),
	employed BOOLEAN,
	id TINYINT,
	income ???
) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.contrib.serde2.JsonSerde';

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/rok/web/hive-serde-schema-gen/users.json' INTO TABLE data;
```

Take a few moments to examine the result.

You should notice the `???` symbol twice, which means the data type couldn't be inferred from the dataset (the data in every row is either `null` or not present). Therefore it's recommended to check the generated file by hand, before running it.

If you are woundering how we determined the parameters of a `VARCHAR(n)` and `NUMERIC(p, s)` columns, read the next chapter.

Numeric types
===

This schema generator is able to automatically infer the strictest possible data type to store all the values in a column without the loss of information.

If column is integral for all rows (= without the fractional part, like `10`, not like `10.0` or `1.23`), then the generated type is going to be either one of these `TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `INT`, `BIGINT`,
or if any of the rows is bigger than that, `NUMERIC(precision, 0)`.

If any of the rows contains number with a fractional part, then the result is either `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` or if we hit the precision limit of 15 significant digits, then the type is set to `NUMERIC(precision, scale)`.

Exceptions
===
If you feed the program improper data, you will get one of these two exceptions. Both give you the line number and really detailed information.

InconsistentArray
----
SerDe requires your arrays to have the same data type for each element. `["a", {"b":1}]` is thus invalid array, since first element is a `STRING` and the second one is `STRUCT<b: TINYINT>`.

`[1, 12.345]` is however, completely valid, as both of formats are numerical. The result is `ARRAY<FLOAT>` as `FLOAT` suffices to exactly store numbers with up to 7 significant digits.

RowMismatch
---

This exception occurs when we find a line that is not consistent with previous ones. If we have this simple file:

```json
{"names": ["Rok", "Manca"]}
{"names": {"first": "Rok"}}
```

we get this detailed exception:

```
Exception in thread "main" On the line 2 you attempted to insert this JSON:
{
  "first" : "Rok"
}
with corresponding schema:
STRUCT<
	first: VARCHAR(3)
>
into the schema with this signature:
ARRAY<
	VARCHAR(5)
>
```
